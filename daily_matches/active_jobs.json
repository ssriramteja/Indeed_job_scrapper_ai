a simple, yet powerful, formula for our success, which we\u2019ve been nailing since our founding in 1997\\. we start with an organization powered by our company purpose\u2014*changing lives with good energy*. then our purpose\\-driven people are given the support and autonomy to develop and grow. next, we are super\\-intentional about designing a culture where everyone feels like they truly *connect and belong*, which is one of our five company core values. purpose\\-driven, connected employees deliver amazing business results. and winning companies with remarkable people and thriving cultures attract and retain top talent, so the cycle becomes self\\-reinforcing or what we call our *regenerative culture*.\nwe don\u2019t mind sharing our formula, since we believe the world would be a better place if more workplaces treated adults like adults and gave them the platform to do the best work of their lives\u2014alongside some truly amazing colleagues. why don\u2019t more companies do this? it takes deep\\-in\\-your\\-bones conviction to your people, products, and purpose to pull it off. it also takes resisting the urge to try to control people, and instead, trusting them to make the right decisions. the result of our vibrant culture speaks for itself: we were certified as a *great place to work*\u2122 for the 9th year\\-running in 2025\\. and we currently rank \\#8 on *fortune magazine\u2019s* best workplaces in our category and were in the top 12 for each of the last 7 years.\nwe have a long list of ways we take care of our people, but here are some

engaging in\\-office events like bring your kids to work day, 6% 401k match after 1 year, generous paid family leave regardless of gender, all positions bonus\\-eligible, company\\-wide volunteer days, company\\-matched charitable donations, no employee handbook, no dress code, coaching conversations instead of performance reviews, and walking meetings.\npnc seeks individuals who will flourish in this type of work environment and will add to our culture and help build this high\\-growth company for the next phase in our amazing journey. does this sound like you? then read on\u2026\nwe believe in the power of mindset, and specifically what we call the *challenger mindset*. do you take smart, bold risks, display relentless hunger, and see yourself as a builder? we\u2019re looking for individuals who choose action over analysis paralysis\u2014those who start before they feel completely ready, make calculated moves based on the best information available, and build momentum through decisive action rather than perfect planning. you should have an insatiable drive that keeps you agile and forward\\-thinking, always challenging assumptions, seeking new opportunities, and focusing on long\\-term impact over short\\-term wins. above all, you\u2019re a builder\u2014someone who transforms the status quo, finds smarter, simpler, faster ways to get things done, and inspires others

short series of in\\-person or video interviews in a 1:1 setting; these are usually with the hiring manager, one or two other team members, and a person from another team to get broader perspectives (note: we don\u2019t do panel interviews because they don\u2019t give interviewers a chance to ask you unique questions, and we assign interviewers different roles so we\u2019re probing different capabilities)\n* a case study or job task to simulate what you\u2019d actually be doing in the role might be included (since your job is not actually to be interviewed for a living, why is that the thing companies rely on so much?) yes, there will be a small panel for this one so you don\u2019t have to do it more than once, and yes, they might ask you some kind yet probing questions at the end after the raucous applause stops.\n* once your interview concludes, the team will meet for an in\\-depth consultative process to ensure we are hiring the right person for the right job. interviewers must come in with a strong **yes** or **no** vote beforehand to avoid groupthink with supporting reasons. the collective thoughts on your candidacy will be discussed in an environment of safety to challenge ideas respectfully, debate. and be open to all important qualifications of the candidates. a trained, disinterested bias blocker will be present to help mitigate bias so the team can make a sound hiring decision. the moment of truth arrives when the hiring manager makes the big decision. if you nailed the interviews and the case study was brilliant, guess what? the offer is all yours! and the ball is in your court. will you accept? we sure hope so, because this place is the real deal, and don\u2019t just believe us\u2014just ask the 91% of our people who said this is a great place to work in our most recent employee survey.\n\nwe strive to create an equitable and inclusive environment to contribute to the success of our organization. premier nutrition provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital status,
