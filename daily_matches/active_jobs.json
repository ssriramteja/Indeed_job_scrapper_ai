leadership in the category of protein shakes and powders. we make the brands *premier protein and dymatize*, and are part of our publicly traded holding company, bellring brands (nyse: brbr).\nwe have a simple, yet powerful, formula for our success, which we\u2019ve been nailing since our founding in 1997\\. we start with an organization powered by our company purpose\u2014*changing lives with good energy*. then our purpose\\-driven people are given the support and autonomy to develop and grow. next, we are super\\-intentional about designing a culture where everyone feels like they truly *connect and belong*, which is one of our five company core values. purpose\\-driven, connected employees deliver amazing business results. and winning companies with remarkable people and thriving cultures attract and retain top talent, so the cycle becomes self\\-reinforcing or what we call our *regenerative culture*.\nwe don\u2019t mind sharing our formula, since we believe the world would be a better place if more workplaces treated adults like adults and gave them the platform to do the best work of their lives\u2014alongside some truly amazing colleagues. why don\u2019t more companies do this? it takes deep\\-in\\-your\\-bones conviction to your people, products, and purpose to pull it off. it also takes resisting the urge to try to control people, and instead, trusting them to make the right decisions. the result of our vibrant culture speaks for itself: we were certified as a *great place to work*\u2122 for the 9th year\\-running in 2025\\. and we currently rank \\#8 on *fortune magazine\u2019s* best workplaces in our category and were in the top 12 for each of the last 7 years.\nwe have a long list of ways we take care of our people, but here are some crowd\\-pleasers that our employees often say they love most: year\\-round \u00bd day fridays, in\\-office massages, free lunches \\& snacks, dogs in the office, culture of belonging celebrations, engaging in\\-office events like bring your kids to work day, 6% 401k match after 1 year, generous paid family leave regardless of gender, all positions bonus\\-eligible, company\\-wide volunteer days, company\\-matched charitable donations, no employee handbook, no dress code, coaching conversations instead of performance reviews, and walking meetings.\npnc seeks individuals who will flourish in this type of work environment and will add to our culture and help build this high\\-growth company for the next phase in our amazing journey. does this sound like you? then read on\u2026\nwe believe in the power of mindset, and specifically what we call the *challenger mindset*. do you take smart, bold risks, display relentless hunger, and see yourself as a builder? we\u2019re looking for individuals who choose action over analysis paralysis\u2014those who start before they feel completely ready, make calculated moves based on the best information available, and build momentum through decisive action rather than perfect planning. you should have an insatiable drive that keeps you agile and forward\\-thinking, always challenging assumptions, seeking new opportunities, and focusing on long\\-term impact over short\\-term wins. above all, you\u2019re a builder\u2014someone who transforms the status quo, finds smarter, simpler, faster ways to get things done, and inspires others to do the same.\n\n**the role you\u2019re interested in\u2026**as a data engineer, you will help our company solve their most challenging problems and drive decisions with data. as a member in our enterprise data intelligence team, you will be at the center of data and analytical innovation and adoption. in this role, you will drive value by migrating, acquiring, maintaining, and evolving our data integration process and platform. activities range from data acquisition and validation, designing and implementing etl/elt data pipelines, designing and implementing databases, job suite execution and monitoring, support testing, troubleshooting, and system analysis. you will be collaborating with all our departments to build end\\-to\\-end data infrastructure and pipelines that promote reporting and advanced analytics and further business process evaluation.\n**the work environment\u2026**\nso, what\u2019s it like to work here? if you\u2019re based in the greater bay area, you\u2019ll walk into our emeryville office each tuesday morning and start the in\\-person portion of our hybrid work week at our weekly all\\-company meeting and find close to 200 of your colleagues, some sitting with their dogs, talking excitedly through the week ahead and watching a newer teammate tell their personal life and career journey followed by a quick update on any hot topics that might be relevant to the week ahead.\nwe are a dynamic, hybrid workplace so every employee who lives within 100 miles of our offices is expected to come in tuesday through thursday. we are very intentional about connecting in person for things like innovation, impromptu collaboration, having respectful challenges to get to better decisions, leadership role\\-modeling, and culture building. great work cultures are built on stories about what great looks like in practice, and great stories during virtual meetings just don\u2019t happen. the expected pay scale for this role is $145k to $155k, which

challenge ideas respectfully, debate. and be open to all important qualifications of the candidates. a trained, disinterested bias blocker will be present to help mitigate bias so the team can make a sound hiring decision. the moment of truth arrives when the hiring manager makes the big decision. if you nailed the interviews and the case study was brilliant, guess what? the offer is all yours! and the ball is in your court. will you accept? we sure hope so, because this place is the real deal, and don\u2019t just believe us\u2014just ask the 91% of our people who said this is a great place
